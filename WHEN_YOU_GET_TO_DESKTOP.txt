WHEN YOU GET BACK TO YOUR DESKTOP - DO THIS FIRST
=================================================================

Your code is 100% correct. Android Studio just needs updating.

QUICK 3-STEP FIX:

1. UPDATE ANDROID STUDIO
   - Download: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Get version: Ladybug (2024.2.1) or newer
   
2. INSTALL ANDROID 15 SDK
   - Tools → SDK Manager
   - Install "Android 15.0 (API 35)"
   - Install "Build-Tools 35.0.0"
   
3. SET JAVA TO JDK 17
   - File → Settings → Build Tools → Gradle
   - Gradle JDK: Select "Embedded JDK 17"
   
Then: Build → Rebuild Project

Should work immediately.

=================================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENS:

Your project uses cutting-edge versions (Android 15, latest Gradle).
Older Android Studio versions don't have these components.

This is NOT a code problem - it's just version mismatch.

=================================================================
IF STILL STUCK:

In Android Studio terminal, run:
  ./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace

Take a phone picture of the error and send it.

=================================================================
YOUR CODE IS READY. JUST NEED NEWER ANDROID STUDIO.
