# QuantraVision

## Overview
QuantraVision is an offline-first Android application that provides AI-powered chart pattern recognition for retail traders. It utilizes advanced OpenCV template matching to identify 109 technical analysis patterns in real-time. The app prioritizes user privacy through on-device processing and offers features such as predictive detection, multi-modal alerts, pattern invalidation warnings, and explainable AI with audit trails. It operates without subscriptions or cloud dependencies, offering a 4-tier one-time payment structure (Free, Starter, Standard, Pro) for lifetime access. Key features include an "Intelligence Stack" comprising the Regime Navigator, Pattern-to-Plan Engine, Behavioral Guardrails, and Proof Capsules, all designed for offline use with legal disclaimers for educational purposes.

## Recent Changes

### November 4, 2025 - Compilation Error Fixes
Fixed all 58 remaining Kotlin compilation errors to make the project build-ready:
- **Database Model Usage**: Corrected PatternMatch property references (id, timeframe) across ProofCapsuleGenerator, WatchlistScanner, and other files
- **Paint API Conflicts**: Resolved Paint.Style vs PatternStyle naming conflicts in EnhancedOverlayRenderer using qualified references
- **UI Component Errors**: Fixed missing imports (Icons, color extensions), duplicate function definitions (SummaryItem, EducationalDisclaimer), and Compose syntax issues
- **PaywallScreen Critical Fix**: Corrected book access entitlement logic to properly respect BillingManager.hasBook() for all tiers (prevented unauthorized access bug)
- **Export Functionality**: Fixed ExportViewModel database queries to use correct DAO methods
- **Pattern Library**: Updated SimilaritySearchScreen to use PatternLibrary.patterns.map{it.name} instead of non-existent method

All changes architect-reviewed and approved. Project ready for GitHub Actions build.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application uses Jetpack Compose with the Material 3 Design System, optimized for a dark theme, featuring a declarative and reactive UI. It utilizes ViewModel for state management, a modular screen architecture, responsive layouts, custom home screen widgets, and a consistent brand identity.

### Technical Implementations
**Pattern Detection Engine**: Employs an OpenCV template matching system for 109 chart patterns, coordinated by a HybridDetectorBridge and utilizing a BayesianFusionEngine for confidence scoring. Includes DeltaDetectionOptimizer and TemporalStabilizer, with TensorFlow Lite infrastructure for future ML enhancements.
**Scan Learning Engine**: (PRO tier only) Learns from chart scans to track pattern frequency, co-occurrence, and confidence distributions using perceptual image hashing for privacy-preserving, offline learning with adaptive threshold optimization.
**Data Storage**: Utilizes an encrypted Room database for local storage of logs, user preferences, achievements, and scan learning data.
**State Management**: Implements Android Architecture Components (ViewModels, Repository pattern, LiveData/Flow) for reactive state propagation.
**Authentication & Licensing**: Manages a four-tier lifetime access model via Google Play In-App Billing, secured with Google Play Integrity API, signature verification, and R8/ProGuard obfuscation.
**AI/ML Architecture**: Primarily OpenCV-based, with TensorFlow Lite infrastructure for future Apache 2.0 licensed ML model integration.
**Alert System**: A centralized AlertManager provides voice, haptic, and visual alerts based on pattern strength.
**Real-Time Overlay System**: Uses MediaProjection API for live chart overlay with a minimal, pulsing cyan border upon pattern detection, offering touch-passthrough to the underlying trading app.
**Performance & Power Management**: An Adaptive Pipeline with a PowerPolicyApplicator adjusts performance based on device conditions, with resource optimizations for OpenCV.
**Compliance & Provenance**: Adheres to Greyline OS v4.3 standards, logging detections with SHA-256 hashes, signing pattern catalogs with Ed25519, and maintaining an SBOM.
