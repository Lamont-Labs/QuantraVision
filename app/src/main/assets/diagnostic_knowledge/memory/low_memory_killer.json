  "description": "Android system kills app process due to excessive memory usage. System-level memory management issue.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "App exceeding memory budget for device class",
    "Memory leaks accumulating over time",
    "Large heap allocation on low-memory device",
    "Too many background services",
    "Keeping too much data in memory",
    "Not responding to memory pressure signals",
    "Process priority too low during memory pressure"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Implement onTrimMemory() to release memory",
    "Monitor memory usage with ActivityManager",
    "Release caches when TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW",
    "Reduce memory footprint of app",
    "Fix memory leaks detected by LeakCanary",
    "Use android:largeHeap=\"true\" only as last resort",
    "Implement proper component lifecycle management"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Keep memory usage below device class limits",
    "Implement robust onTrimMemory() handling",
    "Use getMemoryClass() to know limits",
    "Test on low-memory devices (1-2GB RAM)",
    "Monitor memory usage in production",
    "Release resources when app backgrounded",
    "Avoid memory leaks with LeakCanary"
