  "category": "network",
  "description": "Network request exceeded the timeout limit. Common with slow connections or unresponsive servers.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "Server taking too long to respond",
    "Poor network connectivity",
    "Timeout values set too low",
    "Large file downloads without chunking",
    "Server under heavy load",
    "DNS resolution delays",
    "Firewall or proxy blocking requests"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Increase timeout values appropriately (connect vs read timeout)",
    "Implement retry logic with exponential backoff",
    "Show loading indicators to user",
    "Use timeout coroutines: withTimeout { }",
    "Cancel long-running requests when user navigates away",
    "Implement offline-first architecture",
    "Use OkHttp with proper timeout configuration"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Set reasonable timeouts: connectTimeout=30s, readTimeout=60s",
    "Implement connection quality detection",
    "Use WorkManager for critical background requests",
    "Cache responses for offline access",
    "Implement request cancellation on lifecycle events",
    "Monitor network state before making requests",
    "Use retry policies for non-critical requests"
