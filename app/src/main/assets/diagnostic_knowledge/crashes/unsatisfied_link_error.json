  "description": "Native library or method not found. Occurs when JNI/NDK libraries fail to load or specific native methods missing.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "Native library (.so) not included for device ABI",
    "Incorrect library name in System.loadLibrary()",
    "Missing native method implementation",
    "Library compiled for wrong architecture",
    "Dependencies not packaged with library",
    "JNI method signature mismatch",
    "Library not in correct APK directory"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Include native libraries for all target ABIs",
    "Verify library name matches System.loadLibrary() call",
    "Check native method signatures match exactly",
    "Build libraries for all required architectures",
    "Use abiFilters to specify supported ABIs",
    "Verify .so files are in lib/<abi>/ in APK",
    "Check for missing native dependencies"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Build native libraries for all common ABIs (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64)",
    "Test on devices with different architectures",
    "Use CMake or ndk-build for consistent builds",
    "Document native library dependencies",
    "Include fallback for unsupported architectures",
    "Use App Bundle to optimize ABI delivery",
    "Verify APK contents include .so files"

    "android { defaultConfig { ndk { abiFilters 'arm64-v8a', 'armeabi-v7a', 'x86_64' } } }",
