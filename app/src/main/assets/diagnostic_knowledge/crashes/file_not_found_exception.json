    "File path constructed incorrectly",
    "External storage not mounted",
    "File deleted by another process",
    "Scoped storage restrictions (Android 10+)",
    "Missing storage permissions",
    "Incorrect file URI vs file path usage",

  "solutions": [
    "Check if file exists before accessing: file.exists()",
    "Use getExternalFilesDir() for app-specific storage",
    "Handle scoped storage with MediaStore API",

    "Always check file.exists() before operations",
    "Use app-specific directories (getExternalFilesDir)",
