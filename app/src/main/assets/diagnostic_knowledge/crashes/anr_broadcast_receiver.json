  "errorName": "ANR_BroadcastReceiver",
  "category": "crashes",
  "description": "BroadcastReceiver.onReceive() takes longer than 10 seconds to execute, triggering ANR. System-level timeout for broadcast handling.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "Long-running operations in onReceive()",
    "Synchronous network calls in broadcast handler",
    "Database operations blocking receiver",
    "File I/O in onReceive()",
    "Starting foreground service without goAsync()",
    "Complex initialization in receiver",
    "Waiting for locks in onReceive()"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Use goAsync() for work exceeding 10 seconds",
    "Start WorkManager for long operations",
    "Launch JobIntentService instead of doing work directly",
    "Keep onReceive() minimal - delegate to service",
    "Use PendingResult pattern with goAsync()",
    "Move processing to WorkManager or JobScheduler",
    "Never do network/database work in onReceive()"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Always use goAsync() if work might exceed 1 second",
    "Delegate all real work to WorkManager",
    "Keep onReceive() under 1 second total",
    "Use WorkManager.enqueue() for background tasks",
    "Test receivers with StrictMode enabled",
    "Monitor receiver execution time",
    "Document timeout expectations clearly"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "val pendingResult = goAsync(); scope.launch { doWork(); pendingResult.finish() }",
    "WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(OneTimeWorkRequest.from(MyWorker::class.java))",
