  "errorName": "QuantraVision_SmartFilterRejection",
  "category": "quantravision",
  "description": "SmartFilter incorrectly rejects valid patterns or passes false positives. Affects pattern detection quality.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "Filter thresholds too aggressive",
    "Insufficient training data for filter calibration",
    "Context mismatch between filter and current market",
    "Conflicting filter rules creating logic errors",
    "Filter not updated with pattern learning feedback",
    "False positive suppression too strict",
    "Filter configuration deserialization error"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Calibrate filter thresholds with production data",
    "Implement adaptive filtering based on success rate",
    "Add filter bypass for high-confidence patterns",
    "Separate filter logic for different pattern types",
    "Update filter rules from learning feedback",
    "Provide user override for filter decisions",
    "Log filter rejections with reasons for tuning"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "A/B test filter configurations before deployment",
    "Monitor filter pass/reject rates in production",
    "Implement filter rule validation on load",
    "Test filters with diverse pattern scenarios",
    "Collect user feedback on filter decisions",
    "Implement gradual filter rule updates",
    "Document filter logic and threshold rationale"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "if (pattern.confidence > BYPASS_THRESHOLD) { return true } // Skip filter",
    "val filterResult = smartFilter.evaluate(pattern, context)",
    "if (filterResult.rejected) { logRejection(pattern, filterResult.reason) }"

  "relatedErrors": [
    "False positive rate too high",
    "Valid patterns filtered incorrectly"
