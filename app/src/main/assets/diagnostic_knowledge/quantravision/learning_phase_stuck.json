  "description": "Pattern learning engine stuck in calibration phase, never graduating to active learning. User experience degraded.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "Insufficient scan volume to complete calibration",
    "Phase transition threshold never reached",
    "Phase state machine logic error",
    "Scan quality too low for calibration",
    "Phase progress not persisted properly",
    "Calibration timeout not implemented",
    "Conflicting phase transition conditions"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Implement phase timeout to force progression",
    "Reduce calibration requirements for inactive users",
    "Add manual phase override for debugging",
    "Log phase transition attempts and failures",
    "Implement gradual requirement relaxation",
    "Provide phase progress feedback to user",

  "prevention": [
    "Test phase transitions with various usage patterns",
