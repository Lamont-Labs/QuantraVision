  "description": "ML Kit Text Recognition fails to extract technical indicators from chart screenshots. Critical for QuantraScore calculation.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "Low image quality or resolution",
    "Text too small to recognize",
    "Poor contrast between text and background",
    "Unusual fonts or styling",
    "Image preprocessing removed text",
    "ML Kit not initialized properly",
    "Insufficient lighting in screenshot"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Enhance image quality before OCR",
    "Apply contrast enhancement: CLAHE algorithm",
    "Use adaptive thresholding for better text extraction",
    "Crop to indicator region before OCR",
    "Try multiple preprocessing pipelines",
    "Fallback to pattern-only detection if OCR fails",
    "Log recognition confidence scores"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Validate screenshot quality before OCR",
    "Use multiple preprocessing strategies",
    "Test with various charting apps",
    "Implement confidence threshold (>0.7)",
    "Cache successfully recognized layouts",
    "Provide user feedback on image quality",
    "Fallback gracefully when indicators missing"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "val recognizer = TextRecognition.getClient(TextRecognizerOptions.DEFAULT_OPTIONS)",
    "Imgproc.adaptiveThreshold(src, dst, 255, ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)",
