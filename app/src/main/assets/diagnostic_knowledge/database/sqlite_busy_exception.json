  "errorName": "SQLite_BusyException",
  "category": "database",
  "description": "Database is busy and cannot process request within timeout period. Related to database locking but more transient.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "High concurrent database load",
    "Long-running read query blocking writes",
    "Insufficient busy timeout setting",
    "WAL checkpoint blocking operations",
    "Multiple apps accessing shared database",
    "Background sync conflicting with foreground operations",
    "Slow storage causing operation delays"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Increase busy timeout: PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000",
    "Enable WAL mode for better concurrency",
    "Retry operation with exponential backoff",
    "Defer non-critical operations to off-peak times",
    "Use single database instance across app",
    "Optimize slow queries causing contention",
    "Implement queue for write operations"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Always enable WAL mode for multi-threaded access",
    "Set reasonable busy timeout (3-5 seconds)",
    "Profile and optimize slow queries",
    "Use appropriate query executors in Room",
    "Avoid simultaneous heavy database operations",
    "Test under high concurrency scenarios",
    "Monitor database lock wait times"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "db.openHelper.writableDatabase.rawQuery(\"PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000\")",
    ".setQueryExecutor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4))",
    "retry(times = 3, delay = 100) { dao.insert(item) }"
