  "errorName": "ANR_ApplicationNotResponding",
  "category": "ui_threading",
  "description": "App becomes unresponsive for more than 5 seconds, triggering Android's Application Not Responding dialog. Critical user experience issue.",
  "commonCauses": [
    "Network operations on main thread",
    "Database queries on main thread",
    "Large file I/O on main thread",
    "Heavy computations blocking UI thread",
    "Infinite loops or deadlocks",
    "BroadcastReceiver taking too long (>10 seconds)",
    "Service operations blocking main thread"
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Move all blocking operations to background threads",
    "Use Kotlin coroutines with Dispatchers.IO or Dispatchers.Default",
    "Use WorkManager for background tasks",
    "Implement async operations with proper threading",
    "Break large operations into smaller chunks",
    "Use withContext to switch dispatchers",
    "Profile with Android Profiler to find bottlenecks"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Never do network calls on main thread - use Retrofit with coroutines",
    "All database operations must be async (Room handles this)",
    "Use Dispatchers.IO for file operations",
    "Limit work in onCreate/onStart to UI setup only",
    "Use StrictMode during development to catch violations",
    "Implement proper lifecycle-aware coroutines",
    "Set timeouts on all blocking operations"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "viewModelScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) { /* heavy work */ }",
    "withContext(Dispatchers.Main) { updateUI() }",
    "suspend fun loadData() = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { /* ... */ }"
