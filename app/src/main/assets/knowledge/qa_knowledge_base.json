  {
    "question": "How is volume factored into QuantraScore?",
    "answer": "Volume confirmation adds significant points to QuantraScore. Breakouts with 1.5x+ average volume score higher. Declining volume during pattern formation (for reversals) or increasing volume on breakout boosts the score substantially, typically adding 10-20 points.",

    "keywords": ["quantrascore", "volume", "confirmation", "breakout"]
  },
  {
    "question": "Do indicators affect QuantraScore?",
    "answer": "Yes significantly. RSI alignment (oversold for bullish, overbought for bearish), MACD crossovers supporting pattern direction, and momentum indicators all contribute. Each supporting indicator can add 5-15 points to the overall QuantraScore.",

    "keywords": ["quantrascore", "indicators", "RSI", "MACD"]
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does my pattern score low despite looking good?",
    "answer": "Visual appeal doesn't guarantee quality. Low scores indicate missing confirmation: weak volume, indicators not supporting, poor trend context, or forming at wrong price levels. Pattern structure alone isn't enough for high QuantraScore without supporting evidence.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does trend context affect score?",
    "answer": "Patterns forming in proper context score 10-20 points higher. Reversal patterns need prior trend to reverse (uptrend for bearish, downtrend for bullish). Continuation patterns need existing trend. Wrong context severely penalizes the QuantraScore.",

    "question": "What's the difference between 65 and 75 score?",

  {
    "question": "What if indicators conflict?",

  {
    "question": "Does pattern size affect QuantraScore?",

  {
    "question": "How does timeframe impact score?",
    "answer": "Higher timeframes (daily, 4H) generally produce higher QuantraScores due to more reliable patterns and less noise. Lower timeframes (1M, 5M) face more false signals and lower scores. Same pattern structure scores better on daily than on 5-minute chart.",

  {
    "question": "Why did the score change after market close?",

    "question": "What's better: 70 on daily or 80 on 15-minute?",
    "answer": "The 70 on daily chart. Higher timeframes carry more weight in quality assessment. An 80 on 15-minute still has more noise and false signals than 70 on daily. Always prefer higher timeframe patterns for better reliability and follow-through.",

  {
    "question": "Can perfect pattern score low?",

  {
    "question": "How does support/resistance affect score?",
