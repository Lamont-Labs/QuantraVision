  "displayName": "Bearish Pennant",
  "category": "continuation",
  "bias": "bearish",
  "description": "Short-term bearish continuation pattern resembling a small symmetrical triangle. Forms after a strong downward move (flagpole) and represents a brief consolidation before the downtrend resumes.",
  "validationRules": [
    "Must follow a strong downward price move (flagpole)",
    "Converging trendlines forming small triangle",
    "Pattern typically completes within 1-3 weeks",
    "Volume should decrease during pennant formation",
    "Breakout occurs downward with volume spike",
    "Flagpole should be steep and relatively vertical"
  ],
  "invalidationSignals": [
    "Upward breakout from the pennant",
    "Pattern extends beyond 3 weeks (becomes triangle)",
    "Volume increases during consolidation",
    "Price breaks above the flagpole high",
    "Pennant tilts upward significantly"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Entering during pennant formation instead of waiting for breakout",
    "Confusing with triangle pattern - pennant is much shorter duration",
    "Ignoring the flagpole - must have strong prior move",
    "Not measuring flagpole length for target calculation",
    "Trading without volume confirmation on breakdown"
  ],
  "tradeSetup": {
    "entry": "Breakdown below lower pennant trendline with volume spike",
    "stopLoss": "Above the upper pennant trendline or above flagpole midpoint",
    "target": "Length of flagpole subtracted from breakdown point",
    "riskRewardRatio": "Typically 3:1 or higher"
  },
  "indicators": {
    "supportive": [
      "Volume decreases during pennant, spikes on breakdown",
      "RSI remains below 50 during consolidation",
      "MACD stays negative throughout",
      "Moving averages remain in bearish alignment"
    ],
    "conflicting": [
      "Volume increasing during pennant (accumulation)",
      "RSI divergence forming",
      "MACD bullish crossover",
      "Price approaching major support"
    ]
  },
  "confluenceFactors": [
