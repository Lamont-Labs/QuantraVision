  "pattern_name": "Rising Wedge",
  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bearish",
  "description": "A bearish reversal pattern characterized by higher highs and higher lows that converge into a narrowing wedge sloping upward. Despite rising prices, momentum is weakening, leading to eventual downside break.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Both upper and lower trendlines must slope upward",
      "Trendlines must converge (wedge narrows)",
      "Requires at least 5 touches total (2-3 touches on each trendline)",
      "Pattern duration: typically 3-6 months on daily charts, 1-4 weeks on 4H",
      "Slope of lower trendline must be steeper than upper trendline (creates narrowing)",
      "Forms after extended uptrend or near end of rally"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume must decline progressively as pattern develops (key characteristic)",
      "Each rally within wedge should show weaker volume than previous",
      "Decreasing volume indicates weakening buying pressure despite higher prices",
      "Strong volume spike on downside break confirms pattern validity"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "RSI showing bearish divergence is critical (lower highs on RSI while price makes higher highs)",
      "MACD histogram should show declining peaks (momentum weakening)",
      "Stochastic making lower highs while price makes higher highs",
      "Momentum indicators turning down while still inside wedge warns of breakdown"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Very reliable on daily and weekly charts",
      "Works on 4H for intermediate-term trades",
      "Less reliable on short timeframes due to frequent false wedges"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Volume increasing during rallies (strong buying = bullish, not bearish)",
    "Price breaks upward through top trendline (becomes ascending triangle or continuation)",
    "No bearish divergence on RSI/MACD (reduces probability significantly)",
    "Trendlines not converging (parallel lines = channel, not wedge)",
    "Fewer than 5 touchpoints = insufficient pattern formation",
    "Pattern forms in downtrend (rising wedges need prior uptrend to reverse)",
    "Wedge too short in duration (<3 weeks on daily) = likely just consolidation"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Confusing with ascending triangle (which has flat top resistance, not sloping upward)",
    "Ignoring volume requirement - declining volume is essential for wedge validity",
    "Missing bearish divergence - this is the key warning signal",
    "Trying to short inside the wedge before breakdown (premature entry)",
    "Drawing trendlines incorrectly - need clear convergence",
    "Expecting immediate breakdown - wedges can extend for months"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter short on break and close below lower wedge trendline with volume",
    "stop_loss": "Place above recent swing high or above upper wedge trendline",
    "target": "Measure wedge base (widest part), project that distance downward from breakdown point"
  }
