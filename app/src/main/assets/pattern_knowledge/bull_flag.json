  "pattern_name": "Bull Flag",
  "category": "continuation",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "A bullish continuation pattern that appears during strong uptrends. The 'flagpole' is a sharp price advance, followed by a rectangular consolidation (the 'flag') before continuation higher. Signals trend will likely resume.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Must have a strong, nearly vertical prior uptrend (the flagpole)",
      "Flagpole should be at least 20-30% price move in short time (ideally 1-5 days)",
      "Consolidation forms a rectangular or slightly downward-sloping channel",
      "Flag portion should be relatively small compared to flagpole (1/3 to 1/2 retracement max)",
      "Flag should last 1-4 weeks on daily charts (shorter on intraday)",
      "Breakout occurs upward through top of flag channel"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Very high volume during flagpole formation (aggressive buying)",
      "Volume must decline significantly during flag consolidation (profit-taking phase)",
      "Strong volume spike on breakout above flag confirms continuation",
      "Low volume during flag is critical - high volume suggests distribution, not consolidation"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "RSI should pullback to 40-60 range during flag (healthy correction from overbought)",
      "MACD may show slight bearish crossover during flag but histogram should stay relatively flat",
      "Price should stay above key moving averages (20-day, 50-day) during flag",
      "Support/resistance: flag should respect its channel boundaries cleanly"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Highly reliable on daily charts",
      "Works well on 4H and 1H for swing trading",
      "Less reliable on very short timeframes (<15min) due to noise"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Volume increasing during flag consolidation (distribution, not accumulation)",
    "Flag portion retraces more than 50% of flagpole (too deep = trend exhaustion)",
    "Price breaks below bottom of flag channel",
    "Flag lasts more than 4-5 weeks (pattern loses validity)",
    "No clear prior uptrend (flagpole missing or weak)",
    "RSI remains overbought (>70) throughout flag (suggests unsustainable rally)"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Confusing with bear pennant (which has converging trendlines, not parallel)",
    "Ignoring flagpole strength - weak flagpole = unreliable pattern",
    "Calling pattern valid when volume is high during flag (distribution signal)",
    "Entering before breakout confirmation (premature entry)",
    "Missing the volume requirement on breakout (weak breakouts often fail)"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter on breakout above flag's upper boundary with volume confirmation",
    "stop_loss": "Place below flag's lower boundary or below midpoint of flag for tighter risk",
    "target": "Measure flagpole height, add to breakout point for price target"
  }
