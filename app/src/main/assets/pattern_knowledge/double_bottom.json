  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "A bullish reversal pattern that forms at the end of a downtrend. Creates two distinct lows at approximately the same price level, separated by a moderate peak. Signals potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Must have two distinct lows at approximately equal price levels (within 3-5% variance)",
      "The two bottoms should be separated by a clear peak (the 'middle high')",
      "Pattern should form after a sustained downtrend",
      "Time between the two bottoms: ideally 4 weeks to 3 months on daily charts",
      "Neckline drawn through the middle high resistance",
      "Second bottom should not significantly undercut the first (creates 'W' shape, not 'V')"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume typically higher on first bottom (panic selling)",
      "Volume should be lower on second bottom (selling pressure exhausted)",
      "Strong volume spike on neckline breakout is critical for confirmation",
      "Declining volume between bottoms suggests buyers are stepping in"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "RSI showing bullish divergence strongly validates (higher low on RSI while price makes equal low)",
      "MACD bullish divergence (higher low on MACD histogram)",
      "Both bottoms should occur in oversold territory (RSI <30)",
      "Momentum should be increasing on second bottom compared to first"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Most reliable on weekly and daily charts",
      "Can appear on 4H charts for swing trades",
      "Requires patience - takes weeks/months to develop properly"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Second bottom significantly lower than first (>5% below) = continuation, not reversal",
    "Bottoms too close together in time (<2 weeks on daily) = not a true double bottom",
    "Volume increasing on second bottom = more selling pressure, pattern invalid",
    "No bullish divergence on RSI or MACD = weak reversal signal",
    "Price breaks below second bottom before neckline break",
    "Pattern forms in uptrend or consolidation (needs prior downtrend)",
    "Neckline resistance not clearly defined"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Calling any two lows a double bottom without checking time separation",
    "Ignoring volume - valid patterns need decreasing volume on second bottom",
    "Not waiting for neckline break confirmation before entry",
    "Missing bullish divergence requirement (divergence greatly increases success rate)",
    "Confusing with 'W bottom' or 'Adam & Eve' variations which have different characteristics",
    "Expecting perfect symmetry - bottoms can vary slightly in price and time"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter on break and close above neckline resistance with volume",
    "stop_loss": "Place below second bottom with small buffer (2-3%)",
    "target": "Measure bottom-to-neckline distance, project same distance above neckline"
  }
