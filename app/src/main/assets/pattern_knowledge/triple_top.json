  "displayName": "Triple Top",
  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bearish",
  "description": "Bearish reversal pattern featuring three peaks at approximately the same price level. Forms after an uptrend and indicates strong resistance that price cannot break through, signaling potential trend reversal.",
  "validationRules": [
    "Must form after a clear uptrend",
    "Three distinct peaks at roughly the same level (within 2-3%)",
    "Support line connects the two troughs between peaks",
    "Each peak should show rejection with volume",
    "Breakout below support line confirms the pattern",
    "Volume typically decreases on 2nd and 3rd peaks, increases on breakdown"
  ],
  "invalidationSignals": [
    "Price breaks above the resistance level (peaks)",
    "Fourth peak forms - pattern becomes consolidation",
    "Support line never breaks",
    "Volume increases on 2nd or 3rd peak (buyers still active)",
    "Pattern takes longer than 3 months (loses reliability)"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Entering before support line breakdown",
    "Expecting perfect symmetry - peaks can vary slightly",
    "Not waiting for retest of broken support as resistance",
    "Ignoring volume - should decrease on later peaks",
    "Trading pattern in sideways consolidation vs clear uptrend"
  ],
  "tradeSetup": {
    "entry": "Breakdown below support line with volume, or retest of broken support as resistance",
    "stopLoss": "Above the most recent peak or above all three peaks for conservative approach",
    "target": "Measured move: height of pattern projected downward from breakdown point",
    "riskRewardRatio": "Typically 2:1 to 3:1"
  },
  "indicators": {
    "supportive": [
      "RSI showing bearish divergence at the peaks",
      "MACD bearish crossover before breakdown",
      "Volume spike on support breakdown (1.5x+ average)",
      "Moving averages starting to roll over"
    ],
    "conflicting": [
      "RSI oversold (<30) before breakdown",
      "Increasing volume on 2nd or 3rd peak",
      "Major support level just below support line",
      "Bullish MACD crossover during formation"
    ]
  },
  "confluenceFactors": [
    "Peaks align with major resistance level",
    "Occurs at Fibonacci extension level (161.8%, 200%)",
    "Round number resistance (psychological level)",
    "Multiple timeframe confirmation (visible on daily and weekly)"
  ]
