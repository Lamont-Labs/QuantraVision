  "pattern_name": "Falling Wedge",
  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "A bullish reversal pattern with lower highs and lower lows converging into a narrowing wedge sloping downward. Despite falling prices, selling pressure weakens, leading to eventual upside breakout.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Both upper and lower trendlines slope downward",
      "Trendlines must converge (wedge narrows)",
      "Requires at least 5 touches (2-3 on each trendline)",
      "Pattern duration: 3-6 months on daily, 1-4 weeks on 4H",
      "Slope of upper trendline steeper than lower (creates narrowing)",
      "Forms after downtrend or near lows"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume must decline progressively (key characteristic)",
      "Each decline should show weaker volume than previous",
      "Decreasing volume indicates weakening selling despite lower prices",
      "Strong volume spike on upside breakout confirms validity"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "RSI showing bullish divergence critical (higher lows while price makes lower lows)",
      "MACD histogram showing rising peaks (momentum improving)",
      "Stochastic making higher lows while price makes lower lows",
      "Momentum turning up while still inside wedge"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Very reliable on daily and weekly charts",
      "Works on 4H for swing trades",
      "Less reliable on short timeframes"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Volume increasing during declines (strong selling = bearish)",
    "Price breaks downward through bottom trendline",
    "No bullish divergence (reduces probability significantly)",
    "Trendlines not converging (parallel = channel, not wedge)",
    "Fewer than 5 touchpoints = incomplete formation",
    "Forms in uptrend (falling wedges need downtrend to reverse)",
    "Too short duration (<3 weeks on daily)"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Confusing with descending triangle (flat bottom, not sloping down)",
    "Ignoring volume - declining volume is essential",
    "Missing bullish divergence requirement",
    "Trying to buy inside wedge before breakout",
    "Drawing trendlines incorrectly",
    "Expecting immediate breakout - can extend for months"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter long on break and close above upper trendline with volume",
    "stop_loss": "Place below recent swing low or below lower wedge trendline",
    "target": "Measure wedge base (widest part), project upward from breakout"
  }
