  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bearish",
  "description": "A bearish reversal pattern forming after an uptrend, featuring two distinct peaks at similar price levels separated by a moderate low. Signals potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Two distinct peaks at approximately equal price levels (within 3-5% variance)",
      "Peaks separated by clear valley (the 'middle low')",
      "Pattern forms after sustained uptrend",
      "Time between peaks: ideally 4 weeks to 3 months on daily charts",
      "Neckline drawn through the middle low support",
      "Second peak should not significantly exceed first (creates 'M' shape)"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume typically higher on first peak",
      "Volume should be lower on second peak (buying exhaustion)",
      "Strong volume spike on neckline breakdown confirms pattern",
      "Declining volume between peaks shows weakening momentum"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "RSI showing bearish divergence strongly validates (lower high while price makes equal high)",
      "MACD bearish divergence (lower high on histogram)",
      "Both peaks should occur in overbought territory (RSI >70)",
      "Momentum decreasing on second peak compared to first"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Most reliable on weekly and daily charts",
      "Can work on 4H for swing trades",
      "Requires weeks/months to develop properly"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Second peak significantly higher than first (>5% above) = new high, not reversal",
    "Peaks too close together (<2 weeks on daily) = not true double top",
    "Volume increasing on second peak = strong buying, pattern invalid",
    "No bearish divergence on RSI/MACD = weak signal",
    "Price breaks above second peak before neckline break",
    "Forms in downtrend or sideways (needs prior uptrend)"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Calling any two peaks a double top without checking time separation",
    "Ignoring volume - declining volume on second peak is critical",
    "Not waiting for neckline break confirmation",
    "Missing divergence requirement (greatly increases success)",
    "Confusing with 'triple top' or 'head and shoulders'",
    "Expecting perfect symmetry - peaks can vary slightly"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter short on break and close below neckline support",
    "stop_loss": "Place above second peak with small buffer (2-3%)",
    "target": "Measure peak-to-neckline distance, project same distance below neckline"
  }
