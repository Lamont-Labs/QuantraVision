  "pattern_name": "Ascending Triangle",
  "category": "continuation",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "A bullish continuation pattern with horizontal resistance at the top and rising support at the bottom. Shows accumulation as buyers become more aggressive while resistance holds, typically resolves with upside breakout.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Flat horizontal resistance line at top (at least 2 touches)",
      "Rising trendline support at bottom (at least 2 touches, each higher low)",
      "Minimum 4 touches total between both lines",
      "Forms within uptrend for continuation (can reverse downtrend too)",
      "Pattern duration: 1-3 months on daily, shorter on intraday",
      "Breakout typically occurs in upper 2/3 of triangle"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume generally decreases during triangle formation",
      "Volume on rallies should exceed volume on pullbacks (buying dominance)",
      "Strong volume spike on breakout above resistance critical",
      "Low volume during consolidation = healthy accumulation"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "Price should remain above key moving averages (20/50-day)",
      "RSI staying above 40-50 during pullbacks shows underlying strength",
      "MACD may consolidate but shouldn't cross deeply bearish",
      "Each pullback finding support higher = bullish structure"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Highly reliable on daily charts",
      "Works on 4H and 1H",
      "Can appear on any timeframe but needs proper confirmation"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Price breaks below rising support line (bearish reversal)",
    "Volume increasing during pullbacks vs rallies (distribution)",
    "Triangle lasts too long (>4 months loses validity)",
    "Resistance not horizontal (sloping = different pattern)",
    "No volume confirmation on breakout (weak breakout often fails)",
    "Forms in strong downtrend with no prior base"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Confusing with symmetrical triangle (which has descending resistance)",
    "Entering before breakout confirmation",
    "Ignoring volume on breakout (no volume = false breakout risk)",
    "Drawing sloped resistance when should be horizontal",
    "Not waiting for close above resistance",
    "Missing the volume pattern (rallies need higher volume)"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter on break and close above horizontal resistance with volume",
    "stop_loss": "Place below most recent higher low on rising support",
    "target": "Measure triangle height at widest point, add to breakout level"
  }
