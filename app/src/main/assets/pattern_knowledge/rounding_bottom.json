  "patternName": "rounding_bottom",
  "displayName": "Rounding Bottom",
  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "Long-term bullish reversal pattern shaped like a bowl or saucer. Represents gradual shift from bearish to bullish sentiment. More reliable than sharp reversals due to longer formation time.",
  "validationRules": [
    "Forms after an extended downtrend",
    "Smooth, rounded bottom with no sharp V-shape",
    "Volume forms a U-shape (high at start, low in middle, increasing at end)",
    "Pattern typically takes 3-6 months to form",
    "Right side should mirror left side roughly",
    "Breakout above resistance confirms pattern"
  ],
  "invalidationSignals": [
    "Sharp V-shaped bottom instead of gradual rounding",
    "Volume doesn't follow U-shape pattern",
    "Price breaks below the lowest point of the pattern",
    "Pattern completes too quickly (less than 1 month)",
    "Irregular jagged price action instead of smooth curve"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Entering too early before pattern completes",
    "Expecting exact symmetry between left and right sides",
    "Ignoring volume - U-shape is critical",
    "Confusing with cup and handle - rounding bottom has no handle",
    "Not being patient - pattern takes months to form"
  ],
  "tradeSetup": {
    "entry": "Breakout above neckline or resistance with volume confirmation",
    "stopLoss": "Below the lowest point of the rounding bottom",
    "target": "Depth of pattern added to breakout point",
    "riskRewardRatio": "Typically 2:1 to 4:1 due to long formation"
  },
  "indicators": {
    "supportive": [
      "RSI gradually rising from oversold to neutral/bullish",
      "MACD crossover from negative to positive",
      "Volume U-shape pattern clearly visible",
      "Moving averages curling upward"
    ],
    "conflicting": [
      "Volume increasing on left side (continued selling)",
      "RSI overbought before breakout",
      "Major resistance just above pattern",
      "MACD showing divergence"
    ]
  },
  "confluenceFactors": [
    "Forms at major support level",
    "Occurs after significant downtrend (30%+ decline)",
    "Multiple timeframe alignment",
    "Fundamental improvement in underlying asset"
  ]
