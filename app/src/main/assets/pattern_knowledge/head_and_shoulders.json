  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bearish",
  "description": "A bearish reversal pattern that forms after an uptrend, characterized by three peaks with the middle peak (head) being the highest. Signals potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Must have exactly three peaks: left shoulder, head (highest), and right shoulder",
      "Head must be significantly higher than both shoulders (typically 10%+ higher)",
      "Shoulders should be at approximately equal price levels (within 5-10% variance)",
      "Clear neckline connecting the lows between peaks",
      "Pattern should form after a sustained uptrend (not in consolidation or downtrend)"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume should decrease progressively: highest at left shoulder, lower at head, lowest at right shoulder",
      "Strong volume spike on neckline break confirms the pattern",
      "Declining volume during formation is a key validation signal"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "RSI showing bearish divergence (lower highs while price makes higher highs) strongly validates",
      "MACD histogram decreasing or crossing below signal line supports",
      "Momentum indicators (Stochastic, RSI) should be overbought (>70) during head formation"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Most reliable on daily and 4H charts",
      "Can appear on any timeframe but requires more confirmation on lower timeframes",
      "Pattern should develop over weeks or months, not hours"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Volume increasing through formation (suggests continuation, not reversal)",
    "Shoulders at significantly different price levels (>15% variance)",
    "Head not clearly higher than shoulders",
    "No clear neckline can be drawn",
    "Price breaks above right shoulder before neckline break",
    "Pattern forms in downtrend or sideways market (not after uptrend)",
    "RSI shows bullish divergence instead of bearish"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Mistaking any three peaks for Head and Shoulders without checking shoulder symmetry",
    "Ignoring volume - valid patterns need declining volume",
    "Calling the pattern too early before neckline break",
    "Finding pattern in wrong market context (needs prior uptrend)",
    "Confusing with triple top (which has all three peaks at similar levels)"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter short on neckline break with close below neckline",
    "stop_loss": "Place above right shoulder or above head for more conservative approach",
    "target": "Measure head-to-neckline distance, project same distance below neckline break"
  }
