  "description": "Rare bearish reversal pattern shaped like a diamond. Forms when price action widens then narrows, creating expanding then contracting volatility. Highly reliable when properly identified.",
  "validationRules": [
    "Forms after extended uptrend",
    "First half: Broadening pattern (expanding volatility)",
    "Second half: Narrowing pattern (contracting volatility)",
    "Symmetrical diamond shape when complete",
    "Breakdown through lower support line confirms pattern",
    "Volume typically high during formation, increases on breakdown"
  ],
  "invalidationSignals": [
    "Upward breakout through resistance",
    "Asymmetrical shape (not diamond-like)",
    "Pattern extends beyond 2-3 months",
    "Volume decreasing during formation",
    "Forms in middle of downtrend (not a top)"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Misidentifying other patterns as diamonds - they're rare",
    "Entering before clear breakdown confirmation",
    "Not measuring pattern height for target",
    "Trading inside the diamond (high risk)",
    "Expecting perfect symmetry - close approximation is enough"
  ],
  "tradeSetup": {
    "entry": "Breakdown below lower support with volume confirmation",
    "stopLoss": "Above the diamond's widest point or recent swing high",
    "target": "Height of diamond measured from breakdown point",
    "riskRewardRatio": "Typically 2:1 to 3:1"
  },
  "indicators": {
    "supportive": [
      "RSI showing bearish divergence throughout formation",
      "Volume spike on breakdown",
      "MACD bearish crossover",
      "Pattern forms at major resistance"
    ],
    "conflicting": [
      "RSI oversold before breakdown",
      "Decreasing volume (weak selling)",
      "Major support just below pattern",
      "Higher timeframe still bullish"
    ]

    "Forms after 50%+ rally",
