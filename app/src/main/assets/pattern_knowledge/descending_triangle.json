  "category": "continuation",
  "bias": "bearish",
  "description": "A bearish continuation pattern with flat horizontal support at bottom and descending resistance at top. Shows distribution as sellers become more aggressive while support holds, typically resolves with downside breakdown.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Flat horizontal support at bottom (at least 2 touches)",
      "Descending trendline resistance at top (at least 2 touches, each lower high)",
      "Minimum 4 touches total",
      "Forms within downtrend for continuation (can reverse uptrend)",
      "Duration: 1-3 months on daily",
      "Breakdown typically occurs in lower 2/3 of triangle"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume decreases during triangle formation",
      "Volume on declines should exceed rallies (selling dominance)",
      "Strong volume spike on breakdown below support confirms",
      "Low volume during consolidation = distribution phase"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "Price should be below key MAs (20/50-day)",
      "RSI staying below 50-60 during rallies shows weakness",
      "MACD staying bearish or weakly bullish",
      "Each rally making lower high = bearish structure"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Highly reliable on daily charts",
      "Works on 4H and 1H",
      "Needs proper confirmation on all timeframes"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Price breaks above descending resistance (bullish reversal)",
    "Volume increasing on rallies vs declines (accumulation)",
    "Triangle lasts >4 months",
    "Support not horizontal",
    "No volume on breakdown (weak breakdown may fail)",
    "Forms in strong uptrend without prior distribution"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Confusing with symmetrical triangle (rising support)",
    "Shorting before breakdown confirmation",
    "Ignoring volume requirements",
    "Drawing sloped support when should be flat",
    "Not waiting for close below support",
    "Missing volume pattern on declines"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Short on break and close below horizontal support with volume",
    "stop_loss": "Above most recent lower high on descending resistance",
    "target": "Measure triangle height, subtract from breakdown point"
  }
