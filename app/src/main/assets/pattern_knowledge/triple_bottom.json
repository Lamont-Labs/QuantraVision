  "displayName": "Triple Bottom",
  "category": "reversal",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "Bullish reversal pattern with three troughs at approximately the same price level. Forms after a downtrend showing strong support that price cannot break below, indicating potential trend reversal.",
  "validationRules": [
    "Must form after a clear downtrend",
    "Three distinct troughs at roughly the same level (within 2-3%)",
    "Resistance line connects the two peaks between troughs",
    "Each trough should show buying pressure with volume",
    "Breakout above resistance line confirms the pattern",
    "Volume typically decreases on 2nd and 3rd troughs, increases on breakout"
  ],
  "invalidationSignals": [
    "Price breaks below the support level (troughs)",
    "Fourth trough forms - pattern becomes consolidation",
    "Resistance line never breaks",
    "Volume increases on 2nd or 3rd trough (sellers still active)",
    "Pattern takes longer than 3 months (loses reliability)"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Entering before resistance line breakout",
    "Expecting perfect symmetry - troughs can vary slightly",
    "Not waiting for retest of broken resistance as support",
    "Ignoring volume - should decrease on later troughs",
    "Trading pattern in sideways range vs clear downtrend"
  ],
  "tradeSetup": {
    "entry": "Breakout above resistance line with volume, or retest of broken resistance as support",
    "stopLoss": "Below the most recent trough or below all three troughs for conservative approach",
    "target": "Measured move: height of pattern projected upward from breakout point",
    "riskRewardRatio": "Typically 2:1 to 3:1"
  ],
  "indicators": {
    "supportive": [
      "RSI showing bullish divergence at the troughs",
      "MACD bullish crossover before breakout",
      "Volume spike on resistance breakout (1.5x+ average)",
      "Moving averages starting to curl upward"
    ],
    "conflicting": [
      "RSI overbought (>70) before breakout",
      "Increasing volume on 2nd or 3rd trough",
      "Major resistance level just above resistance line",
      "Bearish MACD crossover during formation"
    ]
  },
  "confluenceFactors": [
    "Troughs align with major support level",
    "Occurs at Fibonacci retracement level (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%)",
    "Round number support (psychological level)",
    "Multiple timeframe confirmation (visible on daily and weekly)"
  ]
