  "pattern_name": "Cup and Handle",
  "category": "continuation",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "A bullish continuation pattern resembling a teacup with a handle. The 'cup' is a rounded bottom showing gradual accumulation, followed by a small downward drift (the 'handle') before breakout to new highs.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Cup should be U-shaped with rounded bottom (not V-shaped)",
      "Cup depth: ideally 12-33% retracement from prior high",
      "Cup duration: typically 1-6 months on daily charts, several weeks on weekly",
      "Handle forms in upper third of cup after price recovers to near prior highs",
      "Handle should drift down or sideways 10-15% from cup high",
      "Handle duration: 1-4 weeks, significantly shorter than cup",
      "Breakout occurs above handle resistance and cup rim"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume high on left side of cup (selling climax)",
      "Volume decreases significantly at cup bottom (selling exhaustion)",
      "Volume increases as price rises on right side of cup (accumulation)",
      "Volume decreases during handle formation (pullback on light volume = bullish)",
      "Strong volume spike on breakout above handle confirms pattern"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "RSI should drop to 30-40 at cup bottom then recover to 50-60 range",
      "No bearish divergence on handle - RSI should stay above 40",
      "MACD crosses bullish during right side of cup formation",
      "Price should stay above 50-day or 200-day MA during handle (depends on cup depth)"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Classic pattern on daily and weekly charts",
      "Can work on 4H for shorter-term setups",
      "Requires patience - takes months to fully develop"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Cup has V-shaped bottom instead of rounded (different pattern - not cup and handle)",
    "Handle drifts down more than 50% of cup depth (too deep = weakness)",
    "Handle lasts longer than half the cup duration (losing validity)",
    "Volume increasing during handle formation (distribution, not healthy pullback)",
    "Price breaks below handle low before breakout (invalidates pattern)",
    "No clear prior uptrend before cup formation",
    "Cup depth too shallow (<10%) or too deep (>50%) - outside typical range"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Accepting V-shaped bottoms - cup must be rounded showing gradual accumulation",
    "Ignoring handle depth - handles that retrace >33% often fail",
    "Not waiting for volume confirmation on breakout",
    "Confusing with rounding bottom (which has no handle)",
    "Missing the volume pattern - declining volume at bottom and during handle is critical",
    "Entering during handle formation before breakout (premature entry)"
  ],
  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter on breakout above handle resistance with strong volume",
    "stop_loss": "Place below handle low or below cup bottom for wider stop",
    "target": "Measure cup depth, add to breakout point for minimum target (often exceeds this)"
  }
}
