  "displayName": "Bullish Pennant",
  "category": "continuation",
  "bias": "bullish",
  "description": "Short-term bullish continuation pattern resembling a small symmetrical triangle. Forms after a strong upward move (flagpole) and represents a brief consolidation before the uptrend resumes.",
  "validationRules": [
    "Must follow a strong upward price move (flagpole)",
    "Converging trendlines forming small triangle",
    "Pattern typically completes within 1-3 weeks",
    "Volume should decrease during pennant formation",
    "Breakout occurs upward with volume spike",
    "Flagpole should be steep and relatively vertical"
  ],
  "invalidationSignals": [
    "Downward breakout from the pennant",
    "Pattern extends beyond 3 weeks (becomes triangle)",
    "Volume increases during consolidation",
    "Price breaks below the flagpole low",
    "Pennant tilts downward significantly"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Entering during pennant formation instead of waiting for breakout",
    "Confusing with triangle pattern - pennant is much shorter duration",

    "Trading without volume confirmation on breakout"
  ],
