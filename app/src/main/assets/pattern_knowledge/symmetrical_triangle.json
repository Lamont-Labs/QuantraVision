  "description": "A neutral continuation pattern with converging trendlines - lower highs and higher lows. Represents indecision between buyers and sellers. Breakout direction typically continues prior trend, but can reverse.",
  "validation_rules": {
    "structure": [
      "Upper trendline slopes downward (lower highs)",
      "Lower trendline slopes upward (higher lows)",
      "Lines converge toward apex",
      "Minimum 4 touches (2 on each line)",
      "Duration: 1-4 months on daily",
      "Breakout ideally occurs 1/2 to 3/4 way to apex"
    ],
    "volume": [
      "Volume should contract as triangle develops",
      "Declining volume shows consolidation, not distribution",
      "Strong volume spike on breakout critical for direction",
      "Volume pattern less directional than other triangles"
    ],
    "indicators": [
      "Indicators typically consolidate during formation",
      "RSI around 40-60 range showing balance",
      "MACD may oscillate around zero line",
      "Prior trend context matters for breakout prediction"
    ],
    "timeframe": [
      "Reliable on daily and weekly charts",
      "Works on 4H",
      "Common on all timeframes"
    ]
  },
  "invalidation_signals": [
    "Triangle extends beyond apex (loses validity)",
    "No volume on breakout (false break risk very high)",
    "Fewer than 4 clear touches",
    "Trendlines don't converge (parallel = channel)",
    "Breakout occurs too early (<1/3 way through pattern)"
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    "Assuming breakout direction without confirmation",
    "Entering before clear breakout",
    "Ignoring prior trend (continuation more likely)",
    "Trading without volume confirmation",
    "Expecting symmetrical triangles to resolve quickly",
    "Not having plan for both directions"

  "trade_setup": {
    "entry": "Enter in breakout direction with strong volume confirmation",
    "stop_loss": "Below support for long, above resistance for short",
    "target": "Measure triangle height at base, project from breakout"
