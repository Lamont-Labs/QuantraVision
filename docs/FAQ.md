## üöÄ Getting Started

### How do I use QuantraVision?

**Simple 3-step process:**

1. **Open your chart app FIRST** (TradingView, Webull, Robinhood, etc.)
2. **Open QuantraVision**
3. **Tap "Start Overlay"**

Patterns will appear on top of your chart within 5-10 seconds!

### Which chart apps work with QuantraVision?

QuantraVision works with ANY chart application:
- ‚úÖ TradingView
- ‚úÖ Webull
- ‚úÖ Robinhood
- ‚úÖ MetaTrader 4/5
- ‚úÖ TD Ameritrade (thinkorswim)
- ‚úÖ E*TRADE
- ‚úÖ Interactive Brokers
- ‚úÖ Any other chart app!

### Why do I need to open my chart app first?

QuantraVision overlays patterns on top of your existing chart. If your chart isn't visible, QuantraVision has nothing to analyze. Think of it like tracing paper - you need something underneath first.

### Can I use QuantraVision on desktop?

Currently, QuantraVision is Android-only. iOS, web, and desktop versions are on the roadmap for 2027+.

## üéØ Pattern Detection

### How many patterns can QuantraVision detect?

**108 unique chart patterns** across three categories:
- **Bullish:** 60 patterns
- **Bearish:** 40 patterns
- **Neutral/Continuation:** 8 patterns

### How accurate is the pattern detection?

**93.2% mAP@0.5** (Mean Average Precision)
- YOLOv8 ML model: Trained on 9,000 real trading charts
- OpenCV templates: 119 reference images
- Bayesian fusion: Combines both for higher accuracy
- Temporal stability: Eliminates false positives

### What do the different pattern colors mean?

- **üü¢ Green:** Bullish patterns (potential price increase)
- **üî¥ Red:** Bearish patterns (potential price decrease)
- **üîµ Blue:** Forming patterns (40-85% complete)
- **‚ö™ White:** Neutral/continuation patterns

### What is pattern strength scoring?

Patterns are graded by confidence:
- **üü¢ Strong (80-100%):** A+ to A grade - High reliability
- **üü° Moderate (60-80%):** B to C grade - Medium reliability
- **üî¥ Weak (40-60%):** D to F grade - Low reliability

Higher scores = more reliable patterns.

### Can QuantraVision predict future prices?

**NO.** QuantraVision detects patterns, not future prices. It shows:
- ‚úÖ Pattern formations (what's happening now)
- ‚úÖ Pattern completion percentages
- ‚úÖ Historical pattern reliability
- ‚ùå Guaranteed future price movements

**Trading involves risk. QuantraVision is a tool, not financial advice.**

## üé§ Features

### What are voice announcements?

QuantraVision can speak pattern detections out loud:
- "Head and Shoulders forming - 75% complete, strong confidence"
- "Double Top detected - bearish signal, moderate strength"
- "Pattern invalidated - neckline broken"

Perfect for hands-free trading! Enable in Settings ‚Üí Alerts.

### What are haptic feedback patterns?

Your phone vibrates differently for each pattern type:
- **2 buzzes:** Bullish pattern
- **3 buzzes:** Bearish pattern
- **Long buzz:** High confidence (>80%)
- **Double long buzz:** Pattern invalidated

Glanceable alerts without looking at your screen!

### What is pattern invalidation detection?

Patterns can "break" their formation rules. QuantraVision alerts you when:
- Head & Shoulders neckline is broken
- Triangle diverges from trend
- Support/resistance levels fail
- Pattern formation reverses

This prevents false signals!

### What is the Smart Watchlist? (Pro)

Auto-scanning feature that monitors multiple symbols:
- Scans every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Detects patterns across your watchlist
- Proactive alerts for opportunities
- Pattern clustering analysis
- Bullish/bearish counts

Set it and forget it!
