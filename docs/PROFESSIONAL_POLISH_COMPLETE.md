---

## 🎯 Transformation Summary

QuantraVision has been transformed from a development repository into a **professional lab-quality project** ready for GitHub publication. Every aspect has been polished to meet or exceed professional software engineering standards.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Root Directory Cleanup** (50+ → 11 Files)

**Before:**
- 50+ mixed files and directories in root
- Scattered documentation everywhere
- Temporary debug files (hs_err_pid*.log)
- Development artifacts
- Inconsistent organization

**After:**
```
QuantraVision/
├── build.gradle.kts           # Root build configuration
├── settings.gradle.kts        # Gradle settings
├── gradle.properties          # Build properties
├── gradlew / gradlew.bat      # Gradle wrappers
├── README.md                  # Professional README with badges
├── LICENSE                    # MIT License
├── CONTRIBUTING.md            # Development guidelines
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md         # Contributor Covenant 2.1
├── SECURITY.md                # Security policy
├── replit.md                  # Replit development notes
└── [26 organized directories]
```

**Result:** Clean, professional root directory with only essential files.
