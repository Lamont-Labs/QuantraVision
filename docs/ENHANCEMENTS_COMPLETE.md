## 🎯 Next Actions for You

### **1. Enable Dependabot** (1 minute)

On GitHub:
- Settings → Security → Dependabot
- Enable "Dependabot alerts"
- Enable "Dependabot security updates"
- Enable "Dependabot version updates"

Dependabot will start creating PRs next Monday!

---

### **2. Apply Labels** (2 minutes)

Option A - Manual:
- Go to Issues → Labels

# Import from labels.yml (requires gh extension)
```

Or use a GitHub Action to sync labels automatically.

---

### **3. Configure Branch Protection** (3 minutes)

GitHub → Settings → Branches → Add rule:

```bash
git checkout -b test-ci
echo "# Test" >> README.md
