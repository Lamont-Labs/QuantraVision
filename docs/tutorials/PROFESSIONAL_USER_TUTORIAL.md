**Example Announcements:**
- *"Head and Shoulders forming - 75% complete, strong confidence"*
- *"Double Bottom detected - 92% confidence, bullish signal"*
- *"Triangle pattern invalidated - neckline broken"*

**How to Enable:**

### 3. Haptic Feedback (Feel the Market)

**What It Does:**  
Multi-modal vibration patterns provide glanceable alerts without looking at screen.

**Vibration Patterns:**
- **2 short buzzes** = Bullish pattern detected
- **3 short buzzes** = Bearish pattern detected
- **1 long buzz** = High confidence pattern (>85%)
- **2 long buzzes** = Pattern invalidated

**How to Enable:**

3. Test vibration patterns
4. Adjust intensity (Low/Medium/High)

**Benefits:**

### 4. Pattern Strength Scoring

**What It Does:**  
Three-tier categorization system with color coding and letter grades.

**Strength Tiers:**

üî¥ **Weak (40-60%)**
- Formation: 40-60% complete
- Confidence: C to F grade
- Action: Monitor, wait for confirmation
- Risk: High false positive risk

üü° **Moderate (60-80%)**
- Formation: 60-80% complete
- Confidence: B to B+ grade
- Action: Consider entry with tight stop-loss
- Risk: Medium risk/reward

üü¢ **Strong (80-100%)**
- Formation: 80-100% complete
- Confidence: A to A+ grade
- Action: High probability trade setup
- Risk: Lower false positive risk

**How to Interpret:**

```
Pattern: Head & Shoulders
Formation: 85% complete (Strong üü¢)
Confidence: A- (87%)
Status: Ready for potential trade

Interpretation:
‚úÖ Pattern almost fully formed
‚úÖ High AI confidence
‚úÖ Good risk/reward setup
‚ö†Ô∏è Still not financial advice - do your own research
```

### 5. Pattern Invalidation Detection

**What It Does:**  
Real-time detection when patterns break their formation rules.

**Invalidation Triggers:**

**Head & Shoulders:**
- Neckline broken upward (false breakdown)
- Right shoulder exceeds head height
- Volume doesn't confirm

**Triangle:**
- Price breaks opposite direction
- Trendlines diverge (not converging)
- Pattern takes too long to complete

**Double Top/Bottom:**
- Third peak forms (becomes triple top)
- Neckline violated prematurely
- Volume pattern incorrect

**Alerts:**
- üîä Voice: *"Head and Shoulders invalidated - neckline broken"*
- üì≥ Haptic: Double long buzz
- üì± Visual: Red X overlay with explanation

**Why It Matters:**  
Prevents trading on broken patterns, reduces losses from invalidated setups.

```

**Active Trading:**
```
1. Open trading chart (TradingView, etc.)
2. Activate QuantraVision overlay
3. Wait for pattern detections (5-10 seconds)
4. Verify on multiple timeframes
5. Check pattern strength (aim for üü¢ Strong)

### 2. Maximizing Detection Accuracy

**Chart Quality Tips:**
‚úÖ Use clean, uncluttered charts  
‚úÖ Standard candlestick style (red/green)  
‚úÖ Sufficient chart history (50+ bars visible)  
‚úÖ Clear timeframe labels visible  
‚úÖ Good lighting/screen brightness  

‚ùå Avoid overly zoomed in/out charts  
‚ùå Avoid charts with heavy indicator overlays  
‚ùå Avoid exotic chart types (Heikin-Ashi, Renko)  
‚ùå Avoid very dark/light chart themes  

**Optimal Timeframes:**
- **1-5 minute:** Scalping (high false positive risk)
- **15-60 minute:** Day trading (balanced)
- **4-hour - Daily:** Swing trading (best accuracy)
- **Weekly+:** Position trading (fewer signals)

**Recommendation:** Focus on 4H and Daily charts for highest accuracy.

### 3. Combining Multiple Signals

**Pattern Confluence Checklist:**

‚úÖ Same pattern on multiple timeframes  
‚úÖ High confidence score (A- or better)

5. **Your own research** (QuantraVision is educational)

**QuantraVision's Role:**
- ‚úÖ Pattern identification tool
- ‚úÖ Educational resource
- ‚úÖ Alert system for opportunities
- ‚ùå NOT a trading signal service
- ‚ùå NOT financial advice
- ‚ùå NOT guaranteed to be accurate

**Your Responsibility:**
