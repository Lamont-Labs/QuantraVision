**Free Tier Quota:**
- Standard: 3-5 pattern highlights per session
- After quota: Upgrade prompt appears

### 2. Voice Announcements (Hands-Free Trading)

**What It Does:**  
Android TextToSpeech announces pattern detections so you can trade hands-free.

**Example Announcements:**
- *"Head and Shoulders forming - 75% complete, strong confidence"*
- *"Double Bottom detected - 92% confidence, bullish signal"*
- *"Triangle pattern invalidated - neckline broken"*

**How to Enable:**

1. Go to **Settings → Voice & Sound**
2. Enable **"Voice Announcements"**
3. Choose announcement types:
   - ✅ High confidence detections (>80%)
   - ✅ Forming patterns (40-85% complete)
   - ✅ Pattern invalidations
   - ✅ Watchlist alerts

**Voice Settings:**
- **Volume:** Adjustable (0-100%)
- **Speed:** Normal, Slow, Fast
- **Language:** English (US)
- **Privacy:** 100% offline, no internet required

**Use Cases:**
- Driving (monitor markets while commuting)
- Multi-tasking (cook, exercise, work)
- Accessibility (visual impairment support)

### 3. Haptic Feedback (Feel the Market)

**What It Does:**  
Multi-modal vibration patterns provide glanceable alerts without looking at screen.

**Vibration Patterns:**
- **2 short buzzes** = Bullish pattern detected
- **3 short buzzes** = Bearish pattern detected
- **1 long buzz** = High confidence pattern (>85%)
- **2 long buzzes** = Pattern invalidated

**How to Enable:**

1. **Settings → Voice & Sound → Haptic Feedback**
2. Enable **"Pattern Vibrations"**
3. Test vibration patterns
4. Adjust intensity (Low/Medium/High)

**Benefits:**
- Trade during meetings (silent alerts)
- Quick glance-free confirmations
- Multi-sensory pattern awareness
- Accessibility feature

### 4. Pattern Strength Scoring

**What It Does:**  
Three-tier categorization system with color coding and letter grades.

**Strength Tiers:**

🔴 **Weak (40-60%)**
- Formation: 40-60% complete
- Confidence: C to F grade
- Action: Monitor, wait for confirmation
- Risk: High false positive risk

🟡 **Moderate (60-80%)**
- Formation: 60-80% complete
- Confidence: B to B+ grade
- Action: Consider entry with tight stop-loss
- Risk: Medium risk/reward

🟢 **Strong (80-100%)**
- Formation: 80-100% complete
- Confidence: A to A+ grade
- Action: High probability trade setup
- Risk: Lower false positive risk

**How to Interpret:**

```
Pattern: Head & Shoulders
Formation: 85% complete (Strong 🟢)
Confidence: A- (87%)
Status: Ready for potential trade

Interpretation:
✅ Pattern almost fully formed
✅ High AI confidence
✅ Good risk/reward setup
⚠️ Still not financial advice - do your own research
```

### 5. Pattern Invalidation Detection

**What It Does:**  
Real-time detection when patterns break their formation rules.

**Invalidation Triggers:**

**Head & Shoulders:**
- Neckline broken upward (false breakdown)
- Right shoulder exceeds head height
- Volume doesn't confirm

**Triangle:**
- Price breaks opposite direction
- Trendlines diverge (not converging)
- Pattern takes too long to complete

**Double Top/Bottom:**
- Third peak forms (becomes triple top)
- Neckline violated prematurely
- Volume pattern incorrect

**Alerts:**
- 🔊 Voice: *"Head and Shoulders invalidated - neckline broken"*
- 📳 Haptic: Double long buzz
- 📱 Visual: Red X overlay with explanation

**Why It Matters:**  
Prevents trading on broken patterns, reduces losses from invalidated setups.

### 2. Maximizing Detection Accuracy

**Chart Quality Tips:**
✅ Use clean, uncluttered charts

✅ Sufficient chart history (50+ bars visible)  
✅ Clear timeframe labels visible  
✅ Good lighting/screen brightness  

❌ Avoid overly zoomed in/out charts  
❌ Avoid charts with heavy indicator overlays  
❌ Avoid exotic chart types (Heikin-Ashi, Renko)  
❌ Avoid very dark/light chart themes  

**Optimal Timeframes:**
- **1-5 minute:** Scalping (high false positive risk)
- **15-60 minute:** Day trading (balanced)
- **4-hour - Daily:** Swing trading (best accuracy)
- **Weekly+:** Position trading (fewer signals)

**Recommendation:** Focus on 4H and Daily charts for highest accuracy.

### 3. Combining Multiple Signals

**Pattern Confluence Checklist:**

✅ Same pattern on multiple timeframes  
✅ High confidence score (A- or better)  
✅ Strong formation (80%+ complete)  
✅ Volume confirming pattern  
✅ No invalidation signals  
✅ Aligns with overall trend  
✅ Clear support/resistance levels  

**Example High-Probability Setup:**
```
Symbol: TSLA
Timeframe Confluence:
- 1H: Bullish Flag (78%) ✅
- 4H: Cup & Handle (85%) ✅
- Daily: Ascending Triangle (90%) ✅

Additional Confirmations:

Risk/Reward: 3:1
Action: Educational setup to study
```

### 4. Risk Management

**Never Trade Without:**

2. **Position sizing** (max 1-2% account risk)
3. **Exit plan** (know profit targets)
4. **Pattern confirmation** (wait for completion)
5. **Your own research** (QuantraVision is educational)

**QuantraVision's Role:**
- ✅ Pattern identification tool
- ✅ Educational resource
- ✅ Alert system for opportunities
- ❌ NOT a trading signal service
- ❌ NOT financial advice
- ❌ NOT guaranteed to be accurate

**Your Responsibility:**
- Do independent analysis
- Understand each pattern
- Verify on multiple sources
- Practice with paper trading first
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
