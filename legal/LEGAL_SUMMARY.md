## ⚠️ Remaining Recommendations

### 1. Consult a Lawyer (Recommended)
**Why:** While these disclaimers are comprehensive, a licensed attorney can:
- Review for compliance with your state's laws
- Ensure compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations
- Add jurisdiction-specific clauses
- Verify arbitration clause enforceability in your state

**Cost:** ~$500-$1,500 for legal review (one-time)

**Recommendation:** Consult attorney before launching on Google Play.

---

### 2. Add Jurisdiction-Specific Clause (Optional)
**Current:** Generic U.S. law (Section 14 of Terms of Use)

**Recommended:** Specify your state:
```
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of [YOUR STATE], 
United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.
```

**To Do:** Replace `[Your State]` with your actual state in `TERMS_OF_USE.md` line 145.

---

### 3. Trademark Registration (Optional)
**What:** Register "QuantraVision" and logo as trademarks

**Benefits:**
- Legal protection against copycats
- Can sue for trademark infringement
- Adds ® symbol for credibility

**Cost:** ~$250-$750 (USPTO filing fee + attorney)

**Priority:** Low (can do after launch)

---

### 4. Consider E&O Insurance (Optional)
**What:** Errors & Omissions (Professional Liability) Insurance

**Covers:** Lawsuits claiming:
- App provided bad advice
- User lost money due to app errors
- Professional negligence

**Cost:** ~$500-$2,000/year

**Recommendation:** Consider if app becomes very popular (>10,000 users).
