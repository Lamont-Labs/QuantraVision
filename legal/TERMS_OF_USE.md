**Governing Law:**

**Arbitration (U.S. Users):**

Any disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the App shall be resolved through binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, rather than in court. The arbitration will be conducted in California or remotely via videoconference.

**Alternative Dispute Resolution (International Users):**

If you are located in a jurisdiction where arbitration clauses are unenforceable or limited by local consumer protection laws (including but not limited to EU Member States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand), the following provisions apply:

1. **EU/EEA/UK Users**: You may bring legal action in the courts of your country of residence as permitted by applicable consumer protection laws. However, all disclaimers and liability limitations remain in effect to the maximum extent permitted by mandatory local law.

2. **Australian Users**: Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer guarantees, warranties, or other rights you may have under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) or other applicable laws that cannot be excluded, restricted, or modified by agreement.

3. **All International Users**: Where local law grants you mandatory consumer rights that cannot be waived, those rights are preserved. However, you acknowledge that this App is an educational tool and not financial advice, and you agree to use it at your own risk.

**Exceptions to Arbitration:**

Either party may seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

**Class Action Waiver:**

YOU AND LAMONT LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You expressly waive any right to participate in class-action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration, except where such waiver is prohibited by mandatory local law.
