**Effective date:** 2025-10-26

QuantraVision is an offline, on-device visual overlay. It does not collect, store, transmit, or sell personal data. Detection runs locally. Network access is disabled except for optional Google Play Billing purchase flows handled by Google.

## Data We Do Not Collect
- No account creation, no usernames, no emails
- No analytics, crash reporters, or advertising identifiers
- No clipboard, contacts, photos, or precise location
- No device identifiers beyond those required by the OS for billing

## On-Device Processing
All charts, detections, overlays, and logs remain on your device. Logs contain only technical hashes for reproducibility.

## Purchases
Upgrades (Standard/Pro) are processed by **Google Play Billing**. Google may process limited data per their policy. QuantraVision receives only license status, not personal information.
