QuantraVision is an offline, on-device visual overlay application designed for privacy-first operation. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices and your privacy rights under applicable law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## Core Privacy Commitment

QuantraVision does not collect, store, transmit, or sell personal data. All pattern detection runs locally on your device. Network access is disabled except for optional Google Play Billing purchase flows, which are handled exclusively by Google.

## Data We Do Not Collect
- No account creation, no usernames, no emails
- No analytics, crash reporters, or advertising identifiers
- No clipboard, contacts, photos, or precise location
- No device identifiers beyond those required by the OS for billing

## On-Device Processing
All charts, detections, overlays, and logs remain on your device. Logs contain only technical hashes for reproducibility.

## Purchases
Upgrades (Standard/Pro) are processed by **Google Play Billing**. Google may process limited data per their policy. QuantraVision receives only license status, not personal information.

## Children
Not directed to children. No content targeting minors.

## Global Privacy Rights - International Compliance

**QuantraVision is 100% compliant with all major international privacy regulations because we collect NO personal data.**
