# Financial Disclaimer — QuantraVision

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ BEFORE USE

**QuantraVision is an educational software tool for technical analysis pattern recognition only. It is NOT financial advice, investment advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell any security, cryptocurrency, forex, or other financial instrument.**

---

## Not Financial Advice

1. **Educational Purpose Only**: This application is designed solely for educational purposes to help users learn about technical analysis chart patterns. It does NOT provide personalized investment advice.

2. **No Fiduciary Duty**: Lamont Labs and QuantraVision have no fiduciary duty to you. We do not manage your money, execute trades, or provide investment recommendations.

3. **Consult a Professional**: Before making any investment decision, you should consult a licensed financial advisor, certified financial planner (CFP), or registered investment advisor (RIA) who understands your specific financial situation.

---

## AI/ML Pattern Detection Limitations

1. **Algorithmic Predictions Are Not Guarantees**: Pattern detection using computer vision (OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite) is probabilistic and may produce:
   - False positives (detecting patterns that don't exist)
   - False negatives (missing actual patterns)
   - Incorrect confidence scores
   - Delayed or premature pattern recognition

2. **Historical Performance ≠ Future Results**: Patterns that worked in the past do not guarantee future profitability. Market conditions change constantly.

3. **No Accuracy Guarantees**: While our models are trained on thousands of charts, we make NO WARRANTY about detection accuracy, precision, recall, or reliability.

4. **Technical Limitations**: Pattern detection may fail due to:
   - Poor image quality
   - Unusual chart formats
   - Market volatility
   - Overlapping indicators
   - Model version differences

---

## Trading Risks

**TRADING IS RISKY. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY.**

1. **Capital Loss Risk**: You may lose some or all of your invested capital. Never invest money you cannot afford to lose.

2. **Leverage Risk**: Leveraged trading (margin, options, futures) can amplify losses beyond your initial investment.

3. **Market Risk**: Markets are unpredictable. Political events, economic data, natural disasters, and random events can cause sudden losses.

4. **Liquidity Risk**: You may not be able to exit positions when you want, especially during volatile markets.

5. **Operational Risk**: Technical failures, internet outages, broker issues, or app bugs may prevent timely trading decisions.

---

## No Liability for Trading Losses

1. **Sole Responsibility**: You are solely responsible for all trading decisions and their outcomes. Lamont Labs and QuantraVision are NOT responsible for any trading losses, missed opportunities, or financial damages.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LAMONT LABS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:
   - Any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages

   - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
   - Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)

2. **Not Investment Advice**: This app does not provide "investment advice" as defined by securities laws. It is a technical pattern recognition tool.

3. **No Broker-Dealer Services**: We do not execute trades, hold customer funds, or provide brokerage services.

4. **Local Laws**: You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction, including securities laws, tax laws, and anti-money laundering regulations.

---

## Past Performance Disclaimer

**PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.**

1. Any backtesting results, historical pattern statistics, or performance metrics shown in the app are based on historical data and do not guarantee future performance.

2. Backtests may suffer from:
   - Look-ahead bias
   - Survivorship bias
   - Data-snooping bias
   - Overfitting to historical data

3. Real trading involves slippage, commissions, taxes, and emotional factors not captured in backtests.

---

## No Warranty

**THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:**

1. **Accuracy**: We do not warrant that pattern detections, confidence scores, or any app outputs are accurate, complete, or reliable.

2. **Availability**: We do not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation.

3. **Fitness for Purpose**: We do not warrant that the app is suitable for any particular trading strategy or investment goal.

4. **Merchantability**: No warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
