QuantraVision™ by Lamont Labs is a deterministic, offline AI overlay for traders.  
It observes any trading screen and highlights known technical patterns —  
head & shoulders, wedges, triangles, divergences — directly on top of charts, in real time.

No accounts. No data collection. No trading execution.  
It only *sees* and helps you verify visual structure.

All detections are visual aids for educational and research use only.
