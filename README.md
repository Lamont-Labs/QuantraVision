## 🌟 Why This Matters

The trading app industry is broken:
- **Subscriptions extract value monthly** (rent-seeking)
- **Free trials are bait** (then $60/month)
- **Data is harvested** (you're the product)
- **AI is a black box** (trust us™)

**QuantraVision is the counter-model:**
- One-time purchase preserves value
- Free tier has real value (earn bonuses)
- Privacy is guaranteed (offline forever)
- AI is transparent (audit trail)

**This isn't just another trading app. This is a statement about how software should be built.**
