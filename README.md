## 🎨 **Minimal, Non-Intrusive Overlay Design**

### 📍 **Your Trading App Stays Fully Clickable**

QuantraVision uses a revolutionary **touch-passthrough overlay** that keeps your trading platform 100% interactive:

**🟢 What You See:**
- **Floating Logo Button** - Small, draggable QuantraVision logo in the corner (default: bottom-right)
- **Pattern Highlights** - Visual boxes and labels overlaid on detected patterns
- **Smart Badge** - Shows active pattern count (e.g., "3" when 3 patterns detected)
- **Detection Ring** - Status indicator around logo (scanning/idle/patterns found)

**✅ What Stays Interactive:**
- **All Trading App Buttons** - Place orders, modify positions, close trades
- **Charts & Graphs** - Pinch to zoom, scroll through time, draw trendlines
- **Trading Platform UI** - Full access to your broker's interface
- **Everything Underneath** - Zero interference with your trading workflow

### 🎯 **How It Works:**

1. **Start Detection** - Launch QuantraVision, grant overlay permission, tap "Start"
2. **Logo Appears** - Small floating button shows in corner (fully draggable)
3. **Pattern Detection Active** - Logo shows scanning animation, highlights patterns found
4. **Your Trading App Works Normally** - Click buttons, interact with charts, execute trades
5. **Click Logo for Features** - Tap logo to expand quick actions menu
6. **Done Trading** - Click logo → "Stop Detection" when finished

### 🔧 **Expandable Quick Actions Menu:**

Click the floating logo to access:
- **🎯 Scan Now** - Force immediate pattern scan
- **📊 Dashboard** - Open full analytics dashboard
- **🔔 Alerts** - Toggle voice/haptic notifications on/off
- **🎓 Learning Stats** - View personalized AI learning progress
- **⚙️ Settings** - Customize logo size, opacity, behavior
- **❌ Stop Detection** - Close overlay and return to background

### 🎨 **Customization Options:**

**Logo Size:**
- Small (50dp) - Minimal screen footprint
- Medium (60dp) - Default, balanced visibility
- Large (70dp) - Maximum visibility

**Logo Opacity:**
- 50% - Ultra-subtle, almost invisible
- 75% - Balanced transparency
- 85% - Clearly visible
- 100% - Fully opaque

**Position:**
- Fully draggable - Move to any corner or edge
- Auto-saves - Remembers your preferred location
- Snap-to-edge - Smooth positioning with haptic feedback

**Badge Visibility:**
- Toggle pattern count badge on/off
- Choose detection status ring visibility

### 🚫 **What This Means:**

✅ **Your trading platform remains FULLY functional**  
✅ **No blocked buttons or UI elements**  
✅ **Pattern detection happens in the background**  
✅ **Visual highlights don't interfere with interactions**  
✅ **Only the logo button is "touchable" - everything else passes through**  
✅ **Professional, non-intrusive user experience**

# Align the APK (required by Play Store)
zipalign -v 4 app-release-unsigned.apk app-release-signed.apk
```

#### Option 2: Gradle Signing Config (Recommended for CI/CD)

Add to `app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
android {
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            storeFile = file(System.getenv("KEYSTORE_FILE") ?: "quantravision.keystore")
            storePassword = System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
            keyAlias = System.getenv("KEY_ALIAS") ?: "quantravision"
            keyPassword = System.getenv("KEY_PASSWORD")
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
            // ... existing config
        }
    }
}
```

Then build signed APK:
```bash
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="your_keystore_password"
export KEY_PASSWORD="your_key_password"
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**🔒 Security Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Never commit keystore files to git** (add `*.keystore` to `.gitignore`)
- ✅ **Never commit passwords to code** (use environment variables)
- ✅ **Store keystore securely** (backup in encrypted storage)
- ✅ **Use Google Play App Signing** (recommended) - Google manages your signing key

### Production Build Configuration

**Already configured in `app/build.gradle.kts`:**

```kotlin
release {
    isMinifyEnabled = true          // ✅ R8 code shrinking enabled
    isShrinkResources = true        // ✅ Unused resources removed
    isDebuggable = false           // ✅ Debug mode disabled
    
    proguardFiles(
        getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
        "proguard-rules.pro"        // ✅ Custom ProGuard rules
    )
}
```

**ProGuard Configuration:**
- ✅ Strips all `Log.d/v/i/w` and `Timber` logs in release
- ✅ Keeps TensorFlow Lite classes (for future ML)
- ✅ Keeps Room database entities (prevents reflection issues)
- ✅ Keeps Gson serialization (JSON parsing)
- ✅ Keeps OpenCV native methods
- ✅ 5 optimization passes for maximum compression

### Database Schemas

Room database schemas are **auto-generated** when building with Android Studio:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# Schemas generated in app/schemas/*.json
```

See [app/schemas/README.md](app/schemas/README.md) for details.

### Google Play Submission

1. **Build signed release APK** (see signing steps above)
2. **Test on physical devices** (Android 8.0 through Android 14)
3. **Verify ProGuard doesn't break features** (test all tiers, overlay, billing)
4. **Upload to Google Play Console** (Internal Testing → Closed Testing → Production)
5. **Complete Play Store listing** (see [GOOGLE_PLAY_STORE_LISTING.md](docs/GOOGLE_PLAY_STORE_LISTING.md))

**Production Checklist:**
- ✅ All 109 patterns working
- ✅ 4-tier billing tested (FREE, STARTER, STANDARD, PRO)
- ✅ Overlay touch-passthrough verified
- ✅ Legal disclaimers displayed
- ✅ No debug logs in release build
- ✅ ProGuard rules tested
- ✅ Version code/name updated
