- **On-Device Processing**: All pattern detection and analysis happens locally on your Android device.

To maximize your security when using QuantraVision:

1. **Download from Official Sources**: Only install QuantraVision from Google Play Store or verified APK sources

3. **Review Permissions**: QuantraVision only requests necessary permissions (overlay, storage)
4. **Device Security**: Use device encryption and lock screen protection
5. **Avoid Rooted Devices**: Rooting compromises Android's security model and may expose app data
